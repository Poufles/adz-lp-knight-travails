# adz-lp-knight-travails

## Description
A simple script to understand the concept of graphs and how to obtain the shortest path.

> **Note:**  
> This graph concept is quite easy to understand at first yet the implementation — and especially the shortest route concept — devastated me; it took me time to complete.  
> I'll admit that I used [gushags](https://github.com/gushags/knight) script as a reference. I thank him for this.  
> Moreover, this project is **not** efficient and optimal when it comes to **time and space complexity**:  
> when the board size is more than 100, it takes quite some time to give results.
